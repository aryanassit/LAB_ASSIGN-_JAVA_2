Student Management System (Java)
This project is a console-based Student Management System implemented in Java. It demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, method overloading/overriding, and modular design.
The system allows users to add, search, update, delete, and view student records with automatic grade calculation based on marks.
